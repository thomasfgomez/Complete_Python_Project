## DevOps Part

- Building the infrastructure to run a website. This will include a virtual network, several load-balanced web servers, and a database.
- After you practice basic skills, you can raise the bar; try hosting that same website using Kubernetes. That task itself can be revised, upgraded, and built upon infinitely.
- Adding features mentioned previously such as monitoring and log management, Ci/Cd, or improving security aspects. The possibilities are endless. In this way, all of the DevOps skills outlined above build on each other to give you a well-rounded and increasingly technical understanding of DevOps.
- Every project that you build should be automated using tools such as Terraform and code uploaded to GitHub. This will make the project reusable, much easier to troubleshoot.
